# Define Scenario as Comment
## Purpose
You don't have to define the testcase number for every scenario.

## Previously
To define the scenario number, you have to count where the first testcase for a scenario. if you end up adding or removing testcase in between testcases, you have to adjust the testcase order in "uac" sheet.

in order to remove this task, I added an option to add scenario title right in the testcase row.

## How
Rather than using separete worksheet, you can use comment feature in excel.

in the first column of a testcase, you only have to add comment in that cell.
